		<h3>Low Cost 3D Surround Scanner</h3>

		<p>Bridging the gap between high-end, costly 3D scanning technology and the demand for accessible, budget-friendly solutions, the "Low-Cost 3D Surround Scanner" project represents a significant leap forward in DIY innovation. Developed during June 2014 to February 2015, this project aimed to drastically reduce the financial barriers associated with 3D scanning technology, making it feasible for hobbyists, educators, and small businesses to create accurate 3D models of objects and environments.
			<br>
		<br>
		Leveraging the principles of geometry, the project utilized MATLAB for computational processing and image processing techniques, in conjunction with a low-cost digital camera and a line laser. This ingenious combination enabled the creation of a 3D surround scanner that could achieve the same accuracy as its more expensive counterparts, yet at an 80% reduction in cost. This significant cost reduction did not compromise the quality or accuracy of the scans, demonstrating that high-quality 3D scanning can be both affordable and accessible.
		<br>
		<br>
		The project received recognition and support in the form of a grant of 23500 INR from the Institute of Engineering, Jaipur, underscoring its potential impact on the field of 3D scanning technology. By democratizing access to 3D scanning capabilities, this project opens up myriad opportunities for innovation and creativity, from educational purposes to practical applications in design, manufacturing, and beyond.
		<br>
		<br>
		In essence, the "Low-Cost 3D Surround Scanner" project exemplifies how innovative thinking and a problem-solving approach to technology can break down barriers, offering new tools and possibilities to a wider audience. This project not only showcases the technical skills and ingenuity of its creator but also represents a forward-thinking contribution to the broader community interested in 3D modeling and digital fabrication.
