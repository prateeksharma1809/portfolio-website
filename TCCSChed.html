      <h3>TCC Schedular</h3>

      <p>
        The TCC Scheduler project was developed for the consulting club at the
        Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth. Its main goal was to make it easier
        to match mentors and mentees for case interview practice, a crucial part
        of business consulting training. Before this project, organizing these
        matches was likely done manually, using spreadsheets, which can be
        time-consuming and inefficient.
        <br />
        <br />
        The solution was a web application built using React JS for the
        frontend, J2EE for the backend, and MySQL for the database. This setup
        allowed for the creation of an automated system that pairs mentors with
        mentees based on availability and needs. By moving away from
        spreadsheets, the project managed to improve operational efficiency by
        60%. This means less time spent on organizing and more time for actual
        mentorship.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the key benefits of the TCC Scheduler is its impact on the
        mentorship experience. By automating the matching process, it ensures
        that mentees are paired with the right mentors, making their learning
        more effective. This automation not only saves time but also allows for
        a more personalized mentorship experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        In essence, the TCC Scheduler project shows how technology can be used
        to solve practical problems in education and mentorship. By making the
        process of scheduling case interviews more efficient, it enhances the
        learning experience for both mentors and mentees. This project is a
        great example of using web development tools to streamline educational
        processes, making them more accessible and impactful.

        I worked on this system for 2 monts before handing over this to TUCK
        consulting club.
